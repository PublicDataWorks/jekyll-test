## GETTING STARTED

### Setup Local Environment

Please make sure you have set up the local version of the app before proceeding. To do this, you may refer to [Local Setup Instruction](https://publicdataworks.github.io/pdm-docs/technical-content/new-city-setup-instructions.md).

**Tip:** In the above documentation, we are assuming no changes are being made to the police-data-manager repository. However, in order to deploy a new city instance, we must make changes to police-data-manager and push them to a new github repository. Please follow the extra steps highlighted under the **Github** section to complete this step.
